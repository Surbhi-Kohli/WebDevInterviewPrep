### Promise: 
It is an object that represents eventual completion of async operation.


### Promise chaining:
When u attach multiple callbacks via then in promise chain, u want to pipe the data, ie response of 1st callback should flow to 2nd and 
so on.For this, it is important that u return the data from ur callback

myAPi.then(res=>{
   return myApi2(res);//return
})
.then(response2=>{
    return myApi3(response2);
})
.then(response3=>{
 ...
})
### Creating a Promise
```
const cart=["shoes","pants","kurta"];
const promise = createOrder(cart);

promise.then(function(orderId){
  ///This is the orderId passed to resolve function
     console.log(orderId);
   return orderId;
    })
  .then((orderId)=>{
    return proceedToPayment(orderId);// we returned a promise
  })
.then((paymentInfo)=>{
 console.log(paymentInfo)
})
.catch((err)=>{
console.log(err);
})
.then(()=>{
console.log("this is like finally");
})

function createOrder(cart){
    //promise constructor takes a function which accepts resolve and reject as 2 arguments.These are 2 function given by
   //js to build promises 
  const pr  = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
    //create an order
    if(!validateCart(cart)){
       const err = new Error("Cart is not valid")
        reject(err);
     }
   const orderId = "12345";
  if(orderId){
  setTimeout(()=>resolve(orderId),5000);
}
});

return pr;
}
const validateCart =(cart)=>{
//add validations...
return true;
}
const proceedToPayment =(orderId)=>{
  return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
       resolve("Payment Successful")
})
}
```
### Promise APIs

#### Promise.all:
Promise.all takes array or iterable  of promises as input
Promise.all([p1,p2,p3])
Lets say p1 takes 3s to get resolved, p2 takes 1s, p3 takes 2s. The promise.all will thus give output after 3s.
It waits for all promises to get finished and then collect the result
Output: array of the 3 promises result.
What if one of the promises gets rejected.Lets say p2 gets rejected.
As soon as any one of the promises is rejected, promise.all also fails and is rejected with error that the failed promise gave.Promise.all will not wait for response of other promises.It will immediately give error, as soon as one promise fails
This is like a fail fast technique
#### Promise.allSettled([p1,p2,p3])
This waits for all promises to settle, whether any fails or not.And will give results for all, as array , whether error or success.

#### Promise.race([p1,p2,p3]) => val of quickest settled promise
p1-3s, p2- 1s, p3-2s
This gives value of 1st settled promise, whether it is fulfilled or rejected.It will give result or error accordingly.

#### Promise.any([p1,p2,p3]) => val of quickest resolved promise
You wait for first resolved promise.
What if all promises fail, then the result will be an aggregated error:(array of all 3 errors)
