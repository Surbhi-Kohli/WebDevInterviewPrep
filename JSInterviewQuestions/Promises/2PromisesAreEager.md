#### Promises are eager
```
//Predict the output:
const greetingPoster = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log('Inside Promise (proof of being eager)');
  resolve('Welcome! Nice to meet you.');
});

console.log('Before calling then on Promise');

greetingPoster.then(res => console.log(`Greeting from promise: ${res}`));

Output:
/* "Inside Promise (proof of being eager)"
"Before calling then on Promise"
"Greeting from promise: Welcome! Nice to meet you." */
```
Promises are eager, meaning that a PROMISE WILL START DOING WHATEVER TASK YOU GIVE it as soon as
the promise constructor is invoked. 
In JavaScript, the code inside the Promise constructor is executed synchronously when the promise is created, not when it's resolved or rejected. So, as soon as you create the greetingPoster promise, the function inside its constructor is executed, logging the message to the console.

If you need lazy, check out observables or tasks.

### Promises are asynchronous
Observable can be synchronous
Promise is always ASYNCHRONOUS. Even if it’s immediatelly resolved. 
```
const greetingPoster = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Welcome! Nice to meet you.');
});

console.log('Before calling then on Promise');

greetingPoster.then(res => console.log(`Greeting from promise: ${res}`));

console.log('After calling then on Promise (proof of being always async)');
/*Output:
"Before calling then on Promise"
"After calling then on Promise (proof of being always async)"
"Greeting from promise: Welcome! Nice to meet you."
```
The message from within then method callback function
will be the last one even though the Promise is resolved without a delay, 
since the call is added to the microtasks queue which will be processed
after the current macrotask’s completion.

### how to make promises lazy
//Consider the above example
```
 const greetingPoster = function(){
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log('Inside Promise (Is it eager Now???)');
  resolve('Welcome! Nice to meet you.');
});
}
 /*now unless and untill we explicitly call the function that wraps
  the promise,the promise contents don't get printed
 So only when we run the following code ,will we have the  logs
 greetingPoster();//Inside Promise (Is it eager Now???)
 */

//If we run
greetingPoster()
.then(res=>{
  console.log(res)
})
//Inside Promise (Is it eager Now???)
//Welcome! Nice to meet you.
```
If the intent is to create a Promise that allows control of when it starts executing,i.e ,
make a promise as lazy, there are no native options. 
If you want the function passed to the Promise to run multiple times, 
Promises don't natively allow that either.

To change the default behavior then Promise creation has to be wrapped in another
function which can be invoked as many times as needed.
 This works because the javascript Interpreter does not go through a function declaration
 unless that function is called.
